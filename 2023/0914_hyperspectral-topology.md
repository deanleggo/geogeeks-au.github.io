Come join us for a casual evening of short talks from local geospatial practitioners.
We'll learn about a range of topics centred on open source tools and datasets, and have opportunity to meet fellow open geospatial enthusiasts!
All are welcome.

The speakers are:

* **Grant Boxer:** Hyperspectral satellite data in QGIS
* **Humphrey Boogaerdt:** Using topology for pattern recognition in mineral exploration and alternate approaches to road centrelines



After the talks we'll hang around to chat over pizza and drinks. The event is free and everyone is welcome, but please register so we can cater well!
