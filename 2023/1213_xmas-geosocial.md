It's the end of the year, and time to celebrate the WA open geospatial community!
Join us for a social get-together at [Market Grounds](https://marketgrounds.com.au) in Perth.

We've had a busy Geogeeks year, and it'll be great to catch up with everyone over some food and drinks.
Your first drink is on us, thanks to [OSGeo Oceania](https://osgeo-oceania.org/)!

We have tables booked outside. Come find us and weâ€™ll connect you with a drink!
