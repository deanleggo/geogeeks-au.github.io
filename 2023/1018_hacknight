It’s our last hack night of the year! So don’t miss the chance to come chat with open geospatial enthusiasts, solve problems together and gather inspiration. 

Bring your projects, your challenges and ideas! All skill levels and areas of interest are welcome. There'll be people with interests in OpenStreetMap, all things QGIS, data collection and processing, and more. 

Pizza and drinks are provided. Please register so we can cater well :)
