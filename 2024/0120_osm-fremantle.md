Join us for the first Geogeeks social of the year, exploring and surveying Fremantle for OpenStreetMap. We'll be given coffee, then wander through the Freo streets refining the list of mapped shops, adding amenities, bike paths, and anything else we spot along the way, before sitting down in some office space to do some desktop based editing.

Meet at 11AM at [Culley's caf√©](https://culleys.com.au/), located in the High Street mall, a short walk from Fremantle Station.
We'll start with morning tea (generously provided by [OSGeo Oceania](https://osgeo-oceania.org))
and a discussion of mapping tools and techniques, before planning how we want to map and heading off in small groups.

No experience is necessary! Bring your phone (and if you're keen, see [our list of recommended apps](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Perth/Social_Mapping_Sunday#Getting_Started) to get some ideas of how to get started).
Alternatively, you might like to print off some [Field Papers](https://fieldpapers.org) for some offline mapping with pen and paper.

We'll then grab ourselves some lunch and head into some office space (for those who are interested) to add more of our survey into the map on our computers. This will be a great opportunity to learn a bit more about OSM and its tools from each other.

Coordination on the day will be done via [the Geogeeks Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/geogeeks/shared_invite/zt-13fnotoqb-YkyMTmvwZEB_nDUis_30hw).
